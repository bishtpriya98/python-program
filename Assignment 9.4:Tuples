10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


PROGRAM:
    
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
d=dict()
for line in handle:
    line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith("From "): continue ;
    l=line.split()
    l=l[5]
    l=l.split(':')
    d[l[0]]=d.get(l[0],0)+1
temp=list()
for (k,v) in d.items():
    temp.append((k,v))

temp=sorted(temp)
for (k,v) in temp:
    print(k,v)
    
OUTPUT:
04 3
06 1
07 1
09 2
10 3
11 6
14 1
15 2
16 4
17 2
18 1
19 1
