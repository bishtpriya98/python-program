Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

 

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
d=dict();
for line in handle:
    l=line.rstrip();
    if not l.startswith("From "):continue;
    l=l.split();
    ch=l[1];
    d[ch]=d.get(ch,0)+1;
bigword=None;
bigcount=None;
for w,c in d.items():
    if bigcount <= c:
        bigword=w;
        bigcount=c; 
print(bigword,bigcount);
